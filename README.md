Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following funnel:

Lead Conversion Process - Demonstrated as a funnel
As you can see, there are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.

X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.


Summary
1. **Lead Scoring Analysis**: A comprehensive case study on lead scoring was conducted using a logistic regression model, tailored to address specific business requirements and constraints. This analytical approach aimed to accurately predict lead conversion potential and optimize the lead management process.
2. **Lead Distribution and Conversion**: The lead funnel begins with a large influx of potential candidates, yet only a small segment progresses to becoming paying customers. Notably, the majority of these leads originate from India, with Mumbai being the city that contributes the highest volume.
3. **Data Field Challenges**: Certain data columns contain a 'Select' option, reflecting that the student has not made a choice for those particular fields. To enhance the utility of the data, it is crucial to enforce mandatory selections for these fields, such as Customer Occupation and Specialization, ensuring complete and actionable information.
4. **Engagement Metrics and Conversion Probability**: Higher engagement levels, indicated by the total number of visits and the amount of time spent on the platform, are positively correlated with increased chances of lead conversion. This suggests that leads who interact more frequently and for longer durations are more likely to be converted into customers.
5. **Lead Interests and Specializations**: The primary motivation for enrolling in courses appears to be improved career prospects, with a strong focus on Finance Management. Leads with specializations in HR, Finance, and Marketing Management are identified as having a higher likelihood of conversion, indicating that these areas are particularly attractive to potential customers.
6. **Enhancing Customer Engagement**: To improve lead conversion rates, it's essential to enhance engagement strategies. Targeted follow-ups via email and phone calls are recommended, especially for leads who actively open emails. Additionally, incorporating SMS communication could further increase engagement and conversion opportunities.
7. **Focus on Unemployed Leads**: A significant proportion of the leads are currently unemployed, highlighting the need for a targeted approach towards this demographic. Strategies should be adapted to address the specific needs and concerns of unemployed leads, maximizing the chances of conversion in this segment.
